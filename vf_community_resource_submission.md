Meet GuardGroq: Your configurable, speedy shield for user messages powered by LLaMA!

GuardGroq is a smart and easy-to-use solution that works with Voiceflow's new knowledge base response template. Think of it as a helpful middleman between what users say and your knowledge base, using the latest LLaMA Guard 3 8B model and Groq's super-fast inference technology.

Here's what GuardGroq does: It quickly checks if what users say is safe or not. If it's safe, it passes the question along. If it's not, GuardGroq steps in with a friendly, safe response. It's like having a polite bouncer for your content!

What makes GuardGroq special is how flexible it is. You can easily set it up to give responses that fit your topic. For example, we've included some fun dental care responses for kids – but you can make it work for any subject you like.

GuardGroq works well with tricky topics because it also includes a custom content-based heuristics system that goes beyond what LLaMA Guard offers out of the box. It has a list of sensitive words to watch out for, especially for things which often require factual, up-to-date knowledge for accurate evaluation like rumors, copyrights, or election talk. If it spots these, it can smoothly change the subject to something safe and relevant. The best part? You can easily adjust these settings to fit your specific needs and context.

GuardGroq is super easy to use. It's ready to go right out of the box – you just need to tweak the responses to match your topic. It's perfect for developers and content managers who want to keep things safe without a lot of fuss. And thanks to Groq's speedy technology, it works really fast, so your users won't be kept waiting.
